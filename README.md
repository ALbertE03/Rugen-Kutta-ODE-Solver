- `Functionality 2`: solve systems of linear ODEs of order (2,3)
- `Functionality 3`: solve higher order linear ODEs up to order 5, homogeneous and non-homogeneous

## üõ†Ô∏è Open and run the project

## Requirements

Before running the project, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Below are instructions for installing Python.

### How to Install Python

1. **Download Python**:
   - Visit the official website of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Select the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).

2. **Install Python**:
   - **Windows**:
     - Run the downloaded installer and make sure to check the option **"Add Python to PATH"**.
     - Follow the instructions in the installation wizard.
   - **macOS**:
     - You can install Python using Homebrew. Open a terminal and run:

       ```
       brew install python
       ```

   - **Linux**:
     - Most Linux distributions already have Python pre-installed. To install or update it, use the appropriate package manager. For example, on Ubuntu you can use:

       ```
       sudo apt update
       sudo apt install python3
       ```

3. **Check the Installation**:
   - Open a terminal (or command prompt) and run the following command to verify that Python is correctly installed:

     ```
     python --version
     ```

   - You should see a message indicating the installed version of Python.
